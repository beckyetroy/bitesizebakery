<h2>About The Bite Size Bakery</h2>

<img src = "images/header.jpg" alt = "Salted Caramel Cupcakes" class = "indexheader">
<p id = "about1">
	The Bite Size Bakery is a small, local bakery run single-handedly by Stephanie Sherrard since 2017. Now a mother to a small baby, Stephanie balances taking care of her baby and her business from her very own home kitchen!
</p>
<img src = "images/stephanie.jpg" alt = "Stephanie" class = "indeximg">
<p id = "about2">
 	The Bite Size Bakery accommodates all its customers with its novelty celebration cakes – Stephanie is open to all flavours, designs, and themes. Birthday cakes are the most popular order, though Stephanie has also baked for weddings, company-launch parties, and other events.
 	<br>
 	<br>
 	Although her novelty celebration cakes are what she is known for, Stephanie also offers a range of products and services such as small sweet treats (cupcakes, cake pops, rocky road squares…), homemade loaves of bread, and hot food for catering home events. All products are 100% homemade and freshly baked by Stephanie herself.
 	<br>
 	<br>
 	Stephanie is based in Waterford and, as of yet, only offers delivery service on select occasions.
